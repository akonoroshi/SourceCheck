* When multiple goals exist per RP, the average context similarity doesn't make sense, since it penalizes you for being far from some goal contexts, even if you're close to ~N other contexts (where N is the number of attempts)
* Context matching should consider not just the outer context (sibling nodes to the parent) but also inner context (any child script's children - or just all grandchildren).
* Custom block hints seem to be appearing on the wrong block, or at least come with the wrong "from"
